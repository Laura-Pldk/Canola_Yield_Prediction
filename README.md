# Statistical Consulting Project: Explaining Agricultural Productivity using Meteorological Indicators (Exploratory and Predictive Analysis)

Agricultural yield modeling plays a crucial role in facilitating informed decision-making for farmers and stakeholders in the agricultural sector. However, the complexity of environmental factors and the presence of multicollinearity among predictor variables pose challenges to traditional modeling approaches. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of advanced statistical methods and innovative feature engineering strategies in addressing these challenges on the example of **Canola production** in the province of **Saskatchewan, Canada**. We propose the computation of average
maximum temperatures and standard precipitation indices during critical months of the crop life cycle as model features. We contrast the use of conventional linear regression models with machine learning approaches with particular regard to their ability to handle multicollinearity. We put our findings to use and approach predictive modelling in two different manners, drawing conclusions from the respective performances. Our findings contribute to the advancement of agricultural yield modeling by providing a comprehensive framework that integrates advanced statistical techniques, innovative feature engineering strategies, and a standardized data processing pipeline.

The applied methodology included but was not limited to the following:

- meteorological indicator analysis (e.g., Standard Precipitation Index, average meximum temperatures)
- exploratory data analysis (trend and pattern identification, spatial autocorrelation and dependency analysis, feature correlation analysis)
- dimensionality reduction (Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- regression techniques (e.g., Ridge, Support Vector, Random Forest)
- neural network architectures (e.g., LSTM)
- model evaluation and residual analysis

This work was conducted in the form of a statistical and data science consulting project, part of a collaboration between the BASF team “Artificial Intelligence (AI) Enablement” and the Centre for Statistics at Georg-University Göttingen. The collaboration took place from September of 2024 to March 2024 as part of the M.Sc. program in Applied Statistics.
